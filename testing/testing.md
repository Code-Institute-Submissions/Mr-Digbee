## DevTools

* Testing the responsiveness of the web page.
    * As an outcome I added a number of media queries in order to ensure the website is still user friendly on different screen sizes.
    * I used Bootstrap containers in order to have reactive columns on different screen sizes.
* Testing the css is targeting the relevant html code.
    * As an outcome the webiste is responsive on all screen sizes.
* Console Debugging
    * As an outcome I was able to fix a broken google fonts link in my css file.
    * I noted that a Favicon was missing and was able to schedule this update for the next release. 


## Manual Testing

* All pages
   * Verify that by clicking the logo and company name in the naviagtion bar it directs you to the Landing page.
   * Verify that by clicking the page links in the naviagtion bar they direct you to the relevant page.
   * Verify that the page links in the navigation bar get larger and bounce when you `hover` over them.
   * Verify that by clicking on the page links in the navigation bar the background colour changes to Orange and remains Orange to show which page you are currently viewing.
   * Verify that once reaching a particular screen width the naviagtion links collapse into a burger menu and all the links still work in the dropdown menu.
   * Verify that once reaching a particular screen width the logo in the navigation bar collapses and leaves just the company name in view, also test that by clicking the company name on smaller screens it still directs you to the Landing page.
   * Verify that the navigation bar sticks to the top of the screen when scrolling so that it is always in view.

* To test links' functionality. As a result several dead links were found and updated.
* To assess the flow and intuitiveness of the content placement.
* To see web page's performance in different browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
